# Wine-Quality-Predictor-
Wine Prdeictor, predicts the quality of wine, whether it is good or bad based on a number of factors. The various technologies used are:

Numpy

Pandas

Pyplot

Seaborn

Sklearn

The data set can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajyellow46/wine-quality?resource=download

This predictor shows the co-relation between different factors of a wine with the quality of wine, that is how a particular fator affects the quality of wine as well as plots a graph to show different co-relation between different facotrs with each other. To use the predictor, just add the different values of the given parameters at the end of the code under the variable custom_name. It will show whether the quality of your wine is good or bad. A good quality wine has quality value greater than or equal to 7.

I got the basic idea of making this project from the blog https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/04/wine-quality-prediction-using-machine-learning/

How to Use:

To run the program, just copy the code on an IDE and run it.
